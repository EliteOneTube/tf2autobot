Now that you have downloaded and installed the bot you can start configuring your bot.

First, we will set up the environment file, which you will use to configure the bot to your needs.

# Environment File and Environment Variables

For Windows, the bot is configured through environment variables that can be set using a file (`.env`) that the bot reads when it starts.

The content of the `.env` file:

```
NODE_ENV="production"

STEAM_ACCOUNT_NAME=""
STEAM_PASSWORD=""
STEAM_SHARED_SECRET=""
STEAM_IDENTITY_SECRET=""

BPTF_ACCESS_TOKEN=""
BPTF_API_KEY=""

ADMINS=["<your steamid 64>"]
KEEP=["<steamid of person to keep in friendslist>"]
GROUPS=["103582791464047777","103582791462300957"]
ALERTS=["trade", "version"]

PRICESTF_API_TOKEN=""

SKIP_BPTF_TRADEOFFERURL=true
SKIP_UPDATE_PROFILE_SETTINGS=true

TIMEZONE=""
CUSTOM_TIME_FORMAT=""
TIME_ADDITIONAL_NOTES=""

DEBUG=true
DEBUG_FILE=true
```

### Please ensure that you have file extension viewing enabled in your Windows settings prior to continuing (click [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/) for more information).

Modify the [template.env](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/blob/master/template.env) file found in your `tf2autobot/` folder, renaming it to `.env` (yes, only a dot (`.`) and a word `env`). This file will be the file you edit when you want to configure your bot, using the below variables.

# Required Variables

To be able to start the bot, you need to set a few compulsory variables. **All of the variables in this section must be set or your bot will not run!**

If you have followed the [Before You Start](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/wiki/Before-you-start) section of the guide, you should already have your `STEAM_SHARED_SECRET` and `STEAM_IDENTITY_SECRET` on-hand.

## Bot Credentials

| Variable | Type | Description |
| :------: | :--: | ----------- |
| `STEAM_ACCOUNT_NAME` | `string` | The Steam account username of your bot account |
| `STEAM_PASSWORD` | `string` | The Steam account password of your bot account |
|  `STEAM_SHARED_SECRET`  | `string` | You can find this in the `<yourBotSteamID>.maFile` file inside the `/SDA/maFiles/` folder. Open the file using notepad and search for your `shared_secret`. An example of what that may look like is `"shared_secret": "agdgwegdgawfagxafagfkagusbuigiuefh=="` . |
| `STEAM_IDENTITY_SECRET` | `string` | Same as above (but now search for `identity_secret`). |

**Question: Where can I obtain the above secrets?**

Answer: You need to activate Steam Guard for your bot account using [Steam Desktop Authenticator](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator). This application can be set up on your desktop and does not need to be set up on the system running the bot. Once SDA is fully set up, all you will need to do is transfer the secrets as described above.

## Backpack.tf User Token and API Key

If you have followed the [Before You Start](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/wiki/Before-you-start) section of the guide, you should already have your `BPTF_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `BPTF_API_KEY` on-hand.

You are able to run your bot without the User Token and API Key initially. On the first run, your bot will print out your backpack.tf User Token and API Key. You'll need to copy and paste these into your `ecosystem.json` (on Linux) or `.env` file (on Windows). Please [see this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697415702637838366/697820077248086126/bptf-api-token.png) for more information.

After obtaining your backpack.tf User Token and API Key, update the following variables in your configuration file:

|      Variable       |   Type   | Description                       |
| :-----------------: | :------: | --------------------------------- |
| `BPTF_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `string` | Your bot's backpack.tf User Token |
|   `BPTF_API_KEY`    | `string` | Your bot's backpack.tf API Key    |

**Question: Where can I obtain the above token/key if I am obtaining them manually from the backpack.tf?**

Answer:

-   User Token: While logged into backpack.tf as your bot account go to https://backpack.tf/connections and click `Show Token` under "User Token".
-   API Key: While still logged into backpack.tf as your bot account go to https://backpack.tf/developer/apikey/view - fill in the following for the "site URL" `http://localhost:4566/tasks` and the following for "comments" `Check if a user is banned on backpack.tf`.

## Owners' Details and Other Required Variables

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| :------: | :--: | :-----: | ----------- |
| `ADMINS` | `string[]` | `[""]` | The SteamID64 of your primary account (not your bot). Example: `["76561198013127982"]`. If you would like to have multiple admins, you can do the following: `["76561198013127982", "76561198077208792"]`. Any accounts in this list are designated as an admin/owner. |
|  `KEEP`  | `string[]` | `[""]` | The **same list** as `ADMINS`, **you must fill in BOTH**. Any accounts in this will not be removed from the bot's friends list in the event that its friend's list is full. |
| `GROUPS` | `string[]` | `["103582791469033930"]` | Default group is [TF2Autobot](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TF2Autobot). If you have a Steam group, [find your group ID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/97783524-53a05d00-1bd3-11eb-9778-e92545f2de1e.gif) and paste it here. The bot will automatically invite new trade partners to all groups in this list (by group ID). |
| `ALERTS` | `string[]` |  `["trade", "version"]` | By default your bot will send a message/discord webhook every time a successful trade is made and send notification in Steam chat if new version has been released. To disable both, set to only `["none"]`. |

## Please ensure you fill in all of the above Environmental variables.

### Additional info
 In the templates, you can see the value for `ADMINS` and `KEEP` are `["<your steamid 64>"]` and `["<steamid of person to keep in friendslist>"]`, respectively. Ensure that `<your steamid 64>` contains **YOUR SteamID64**, and that `<steamid of person to keep in friendslist>` contains the SteamID64 of anyone you don't want to be removed from the bot's friendslist.

**Question: Where can I obtain a player's SteamID64?**

Answer: You can find your SteamID64 by pasting your Steam Profile URL link to [SteamRep.com](https://steamrep.com/). Please view the gif below for more information.

![How to get SteamID64](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47635037/96715154-be80b580-13d5-11eb-9bd5-39613f600f6d.gif)

# Optional Variables

## Bot Profile Settings

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| :----: | :--: | :-----: | :---------- |
|   `SKIP_BPTF_ TRADEOFFERURL`    | `boolean` | `true`  | By default, your bot will skip the step to set it's Steam Trade Offer URL on backpack.tf. You can set this to `false` and run the bot, and if there are any issues setting this URL, please manually do so [here](https://backpack.tf/settings##general), and be sure to login using your bot's Steam account. If you've already set your Trade Offer URL on backpack.tf manually (as recommended in the guide), just leave this set to `true`. |
| `SKIP_UPDATE_ PROFILE_SETTINGS` | `boolean` | `true`  | If set to `false`, your bot will attempt to set all of your profile settings to public. This is just so that backpack.tf can load your bot inventory correctly. If you already set everything to the public, just leave this set to `true`.

## Timezone Settings

The time settings listed here will be used in the `!time` command as well as in messages sent to trade partners if their offer needs to be reviewed.

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| :----: | :--: | :-----: | :---------- |
|       `TIMEZONE`        | `string` |            `Europe/London`            | The timezone that you currently reside in. Please only use these [Timezone Formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). For example, if you live in Malaysia, you can use the value `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`. Or if you live in New York, you can use the value `America/New_York`. |
|  `CUSTOM_TIME_FORMAT`   | `string` | `MMMM Do YYYY, HH:mm:ss ZZ` | Please refer to [this article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/momentjs/momentjs_format.htm) for more information on specifying a custom time format for your bot. |
| `TIME_ADDITIONAL_NOTES` | `string` |            `""`             | Optional additional notes when the bot shows your current time. Some examples are your active hours or who to contact if you are offline. |

## Debug Settings

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| :----: | :--: | :-----: | :---------- |
|   `DEBUG`    | `boolean` | `true`  | If set to `true`, the bot will log any errors that occur into the console. |
| `DEBUG_FILE` | `boolean` | `true`  | If set to `true`, the bot will log any errors that occur to a file. This file can be later be used to create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot/issues/new/choose) to report any issues to the developers. |


## Prices.tf token
| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| :----: | :--: | :-----: | :---------- |
| `PRICESTF_API_TOKEN` | `string` | `""`  | Please leave this empty. You no longer need any API Token to access prices.tf. |

# Done?

Then the next step will be [to run the bot for the first time](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/Running-the-bot-on-Windows) to get your [`options.json`](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/Library#optionsjson-content-) generated, and then you can proceed to [configure your options.json file](https://github.com/TF2Autobot/tf2autobot/wiki/Configure-your-options.json-file)
